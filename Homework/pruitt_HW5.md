#Homework 05

1. The 2 ways to design a product are operation-oriented design and data-oriented design. Operation-oriented design puts the emphasis on operations, while data-oriented design puts the emphasis on data first.

2. The inputs of the design workflow are the SRS and DFD. The outputs of the design workflow are the design document and a list of modules for the software.

3. The input variables would be GPA, credit hours, and courses taken. The processing variables would be validGPA, validCredits, and validClassesTaken. The output variable would be canGraduate.

4. Take input, validate GPA, validate credits, validate class taken, determine graduation status, return status.

5. Class name: student; Attributes: Name, Major, GPA, numCredits, classesTaken; Methods: getName(), setName(), getMajor(), getGPA(), setGPA(), getClassesTaken(), setClassesTaken()

6. For my project, the design process is an iterative, spiral process in itself. My project is a battleship game, and, in game design, changes are continually made until all major bugs are worked out.

7. Testing an implementation involves checking to see that it meets the specifications and that there are no bugs in the software, while testing a design just checks to see that the design meets the specifications. 

8. The cyclomatic complexity is 5. There are 8 nodes, 11 edges, and 1 node with an exit point. 

9. One case tool that I have used is Microsoft Visio. It worked very well. It had many preset templates which made diagramming quick and easy, and also allowed for a lot of customization. I would definitely recommend it.
