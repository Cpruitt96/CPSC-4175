#Homework 07

1. Testing occurs at every step in the software construction process because testing only at the end would not be sufficient enough.

2. Verification is the process of determining where a workflow has be correctly carried out. Validation is the evaluation process that takes place just before the product is delivered.

3. Execution-based testing is when code is tested by being executed. Non-exeution-based testing involves reviewing a specification document or design document or code to make sure it is correct and meets requirements.

4. Quality is the extent to which a software product satisfies its specifications.

5. The implementors should not do the testing because a tester with no knowledge of the inner workings of the code would yield more authentic results. 

6. Execution-based testing is the inferential process of testing a program with certain input and finding any bugs that may be present. A correctness proof is a mathematical technique for showing that a product meets speficiations, and is non-execution-based.

7. Software is taking over more and more formerly electromechanical or human-based things. With services like 911 becoming reliant on the internet and being centralized instead of localized, outages are being a serious issue. When a tire goes flat, you look at the tire and see that it's flat, but if software malfunctions, you look at it and see nothing. Software is starting to become more complex than we can handle.

8. I think there will be a software apocalypse. I think their will be a point when machines are far more complex than us.
